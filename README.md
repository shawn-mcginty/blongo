#### Requirements
 * Node 4.x +
 * MongoDB

#### Getting started
 * Make sure mongo is running on localhost
 * install > `npm install`
 * build > `npm run build`
 * test > `npm run test`
 * start the server > `npm run start`
 * http://localhost:5000

 > **Note:** These npm scripts were written and tested on macOS Sierra.  They should work on Linux as well, for windows machines you will have to do the build manually (the other sripts should work)
